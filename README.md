Hello there!
You're viewing my repo that is mainly focused on Kubernetes learning. It will coincide with buidling clusters via rancher desktop using the ubuntu opearting systems. Although not shown, all yaml files will be edited using Vim and Neovim going forward, as I want to engage my learning with these systems. All the while, my networking studies will also be placed into the fray as I also want to engage my learning in that parameter. This is for the end goal to obtain the CKA and CKAD for my personal knowledge growth. This will coincide with me reinforcing my linux and network knowledge, which I have work experience in. CCNA is also in the scope of this by date of may 4th, 2026. If you should have any questions, please feel free to reach out. Thanks.
